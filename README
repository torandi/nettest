A small program for running distrubutes network speedtests.

Usage:
./nettest --server (-s): Start a server
./nettest --client server_address (-c): Start a client and connect to server_address

The server controlls the clients.
Server commands:
clients: List connected clients
tcp n: Start tcp test n. 
	Predefined tests
		0: 100mb
		1: 1GB
		2: 10GB
	The tests are defined in client.cpp (test_urls[])
exit: Exit

The clients run the test on command and then returns statistics to the server that summarizes the result after all clients have reported back (or disconnected).
